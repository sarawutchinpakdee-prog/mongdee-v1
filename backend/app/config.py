"""Central configuration for MONGDEE MINI KIOSK backend.

Every threshold here is a starting point, not a calibrated value — the
camera angle, lighting, and turntable speed are unique to the physical
booth setup and were not available while building this, so these MUST be
re-tuned on-site with the real hardware before the demo. See README.md
"On-site calibration" for the procedure.

# Every live frame's ROI is compared against ONE fixed "empty platform"

# products are flagged for a one-time re-scan) — never reuse an old number.

# histogram (see vision.py) before normalizing, so relative weight here

# below this, the kiosk treats the product as unrecognized rather than
# guessing. CNN embeddings of the same object from a different angle/
# lighting rarely approach 1.0 — expect real matches to land ~0.55-0.85.
